/** \file PixieStd.cpp
 *
 * \brief pixie_std provides the interface between the HRIBF scan
 * and the C++ analysis
 *
 * This provides the interface between the HRIBF scan and the C++ analysis
 * and as such is not a class in its own right.  In this file the data
 * received from scan is first reassembled into a pixie16 spill and then
 * channel objects are made.
 *
 * The main program.  Buffers are passed to hissub_() and channel information
 * is extracted in ReadBuffData(). All channels that fired are stored as a
 * vector of pointers which is sorted based on time and then events are built
 * with each event being sent to the detector driver for processing.
 *
 * \author S. Liddick
 * \date 20 July 2007
 *
 * <strong> Modified : </strong> <br>
 * S. Liddick - 2-5-08 - Added in diagnostic spectra including:
 *   runtime, channel time difference in an event, time difference between
 *   events, length of event, and length of buffer <br>
 *
 * S. Liddick - 5-14-08 - At SP's request, error message and termination occur if a
 *   module number is encountered in the data stream that is not included in
 *   the map.txt file <br>
 *
 * David Miller - 5-5-10 - Significant changes throughout for conciseness,
 *   optimization, and better error checking of incoming buffers

 * \brief interface between scan and C++
 *
 * In a typical experiment, Pixie16 reads data from all modules when one module
 * has hit the maximum number of events which is programmed during experimental
 * setup.  This spill of data is then broken into smaller chunks for
 * transmitting across the network.  The hissub_ function takes the chunks
 * and reconstructs the spill.
 *
 * Summarizing the terminology:
 *  - Spill  - a readout of all Pixie16 modules
 *  - Buffer - the data from a specific Pixie16 module
 *  - Chunk  - the packet transferred from Pixie16 to the acquisition
 *
 * The hissub_ function is passed a pointer to an array with data (ibuf) and
 * the number of half words (nhw) contained in it.  This function is used with
 * the new Pixie16 readout (which is the default).  If the old Pixie16 readout
 * is used, the code should be recompiled without the newreadout flag in which
 * case this particular function is not used.
 * \param [in] ibuf : the array with the data
 * \param [in] nhw : the number of half words contained in the data buffer
